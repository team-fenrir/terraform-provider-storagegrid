## Schema

### Required

- `user_name` (String) The unique name for the user (e.g., 'Test1'). The 'user/' prefix is added automatically. This cannot be changed after creation.

### Optional

- `disable` (Boolean) Set to true to disable the user account. Defaults to false.
- `full_name` (String) The user's full name. If omitted, it defaults to the value of 'user_name'.
- `member_of` (List of String) A list of group names that the user should be a member of. The groups must already exist.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for the user. This field is write-only and will not be read from the API. Setting this value will trigger a password update. Must be at least 8 characters long. Note: The password will be stored in plain text in the Terraform state file.

### Read-Only

- `account_id` (String) The account ID associated with the user.
- `federated` (Boolean) Indicates if the user is federated.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier (ID) for the user, generated by StorageGrid.
- `unique_name` (String) The canonical unique name of the user.
- `user_urn` (String) The URN of the user.

```terraform
# Create a StorageGrid group with S3 and management permissions
resource "storagegrid_group" "foo" {
  group_name = "foo-group"

  policies {
    management = {
      manage_all_containers     = true
      manage_endpoints          = false
      manage_own_s3_credentials = true
      root_access               = false
    }
    s3 = {
      statement = [
        {
          sid    = "AllowFooBucketAccess"
          effect = "Allow"
          action = [

          ]
        }
      ]
    }

# storagegrid Provider

The StorageGrid provider enables Terraform management of StorageGrid IAM and S3 resources including users, groups, access keys, and S3 buckets. This provider requires StorageGrid with v4 API support and is not compatible with older StorageGrid versions that only support v3 or earlier APIs.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the StorageGrid Provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    storagegrid = {
      source = "team-fenrir/storagegrid"
    }
  }
}

# Configure StorageGrid provider with management and S3 endpoints
provider "storagegrid" {
  endpoints {
    mgmt = "https://storagegrid.example.com:9443"
    s3   = "https://s3.storagegrid.example.com:10443" # Required for S3 operations
  }
  accountid = "12345678901234567890"
  username  = "admin"
  password  = "password"
}

# Alternative: Using environment variables
# export STORAGEGRID_ENDPOINT="https://storagegrid.example.com:9443"
# export STORAGEGRID_S3_ENDPOINT="https://s3.storagegrid.example.com:10443"
# export STORAGEGRID_ACCOUNTID="12345678901234567890"
# export STORAGEGRID_USERNAME="admin"
# export STORAGEGRID_PASSWORD="password"

provider "storagegrid" {
  # Configuration will be read from environment variables
}
```
